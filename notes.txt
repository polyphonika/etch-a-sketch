Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
Hint: “Hovering” is what happens when your mouse enters a div and ends when your mouse leaves it. You can set up event listeners for either of those events as a starting point.
There are multiple ways to change the color of the divs, including:
Adding a new class to the div.
Changing the div’s background color using JavaScript.

1. Set a listener on the pixel class for hover
2. Output to console log
3. Decide if doing this or just a simple CSS rule with pseudoclass/type

The goal is to achieve this with Javascript so let's do that and not use a hover pseudoclass
